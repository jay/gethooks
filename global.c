/** 
This file contains functions for creating the global store 'G', which is the store of global stores.
Each function is documented in the comment block above its definition.

There are several global stores (these are referred to as descendants of 'G'):
'G->prog' is the global program store. It holds basic program and system info.
'G->config' is the global configuration store. It holds the user's configuration.
'G->desktops' is the global desktop store. It holds the list of attached to desktops.

Each of the global stores and their functions are defined in their own units, eg prog.h/prog.c

-
create_global_store()

Create the global store and its descendants or die.
-

-
print_global_store()

Print the global store and all its descendants.
-

-
free_global_store()

Free the global store and all its descendants.
-
