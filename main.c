/* gethooks()
Initialize and process the snapshot store(s), and print the HOOK info to stdout.

Each snapshot store is a snapshot of the state of the system, specifically thread information and 
HOOK information at that point in time. This function calls init_snapshot_store() which takes a 
snapshot and then matches the HOOKs to their threads. This function then prints the results.

If monitoring/polling is enabled then snapshots are taken continuously with each current snapshot 
compared to the previous one for differences. The results are printed for each difference.

returns nonzero on success (a single snapshot was taken and its results printed to stdout).
if polling is enabled this function will loop continuously and never return.
