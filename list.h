test include list:
name is required. id is required.

desktop include list:
name is required. id is unused.

hook include/exclude list:
name is optional. id is required.

program include/exclude list:
name and id are currently handled elsewhere as mutually exclusive.
if( name ) then the name is used, but if( !name ) then the id is used.
the id may represent either a PID or TID
