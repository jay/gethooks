/** these are independent structs for 
SYSTEM_THREAD_INFORMATION,
SYSTEM_EXTENDED_THREAD_INFORMATION,
SYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION

I call these independent structs because they do not rely on any undocumented 
types, other than each other.

Warning: traverse_threads.h depends on the above structs but does not include 
this file. You must include either this file or your own declaration of the 
above undocumented structs before including traverse_threads.h.
