======
OVERVIEW:
======

This function can call a callback function for every SYSTEM_THREAD_INFORMATION 
struct (every thread in the system), and/or every SYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION 
struct (every process in the system) depending on the callback's return value.

If a pointer to an output buffer is passed in to this function, regardless of 
if a callback function is passed in, the buffer will receive an array of 
SYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION structs.

If there is no callback and no output buffer (either no buffer or the buffer 
is being used as input because TRAVERSE_FLAG_RECYCLE was specified), this 
function will use the default callback, callback_print_thread_state(), which 
will be called to printf each thread's state and creation time. All numbers 
will be printed in decimal format unless 0x prefixed. 

Follow the directions in BUILD.txt to build traverse_threads.lib.

To call traverse_threads() in your project include traverse_threads.h.
Optionally include nt_independent_sysprocinfo_structs.h before 
traverse_threads.h if your project does not already have definitions for 
SYSTEM_THREAD_INFORMATION, 
SYSTEM_EXTENDED_THREAD_INFORMATION, 
SYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION.

There are traverse_threads() usage examples in example{1,2,3,4}.c



======
PARAMETERS:
======

# [IN OPTIONAL]
# 
# int ( __cdecl *callback )( 
# 	void *cb_param,   // in, out, optional
# 	SYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION *const spi,   // in
# 	SYSTEM_THREAD_INFORMATION *const sti,   // in, optional
# 	const ULONG remaining,   // in
# 	const DWORD flags   // in, optional
# )
#
A pointer to a callback function that will be called for each sti found.

'cb_param' is the same value as the #cb_param passed in to traverse_threads().
It is an optional void pointer exclusively for passing data to your callback.

'sti' is a pointer to thread info, and 'spi' to the thread's associated 
process info. 'spi' will never be NULL. 'sti' may be NULL only if 
TRAVERSE_FLAG_ZERO_THREADS_OK was passed in to traverse_threads().

'remaining' is how many thread infos in the current process info (spi) have 
yet to be passed to the callback. for example if some process info has three 
thread infos, 'remaining' would be 2 when passed with the first thread info, 
then 1 when passed with the second, and then 0 when passed with the third.

'flags' is the same value as the #flags passed in to traverse_threads().
Do not use the flags parameter to pass callback data to your callback.

-
TRAVERSE_FLAG_EXTENDED:

As documented in #flags, this flag alters the request to 
NtQuerySystemInformation().

If specified and your callback needs access to the extended thread info 
members then you would cast 'sti' as SYSTEM_EXTENDED_THREAD_INFORMATION.

If specified and your callback does not need access to the extended members 
then you do not need to cast.

An example is in callback_print_thread_state() in traverse_threads__support.c
-


The behavior of traverse_threads() depends on your callback's return:
-
TRAVERSE_CALLBACK_ABORT:

abort.
causes traverse_threads() to return TRAVERSE_ERROR_CALLBACK.
-

-
TRAVERSE_CALLBACK_CONTINUE:

continue normally. 
continues to next thread info and its associated process info.
if always returned your callback ends up being called once for each thread.

threads are traversed in process order. if your callback continues normally 
all the thread infos of a process info will have been passed to your 
callback before traverse_threads() starts passing the next process' threads.
-

-
TRAVERSE_CALLBACK_SKIP:

skip to next process' threads.
if any remaining threads for the associated process skip them.
if always returned your callback ends up being called once for each process.
-


# [IN OUT OPTIONAL]
# 
# void *const cb_param
#
A pointer that is exclusively for the callback function and passed to it on 
every call. This is optional regardless of if a callback function is specified.


# [IN OUT OPTIONAL]
# 
# void *buffer
#
pointer to an aligned buffer (eg one returned by malloc) to receive an array 
of SYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION structs.

if( !buffer ) then a temporary buffer is used. a consequence of this is if you 
are calling this function multiple times in a loop it will reserve (malloc) 
and release (free) a temporary buffer each call. therefore even if you don't 
need to receive the array in a buffer it may be worthwhile if you are looping 
to malloc a big buffer once beforehand and on each call pass it in.

-
TRAVERSE_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL:

Regardless of if the buffer was passed in or a temporary one was created by 
this function, if it is not big enough to hold the SYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION 
array at the time the NtQuerySystemInformation() call is made then this 
function returns TRAVERSE_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL. 

if( !buffer ) whatever reported size is needed by NtQuerySystemInformation() 
has been doubled to ensure that error is highly unlikely to happen when the 
information is actually requested. But it could. It is impossible to know 
precisely how much memory is needed until the call is made, due to the number 
of processes and threads on a system constantly changing.

if( buffer ) the chances of that error happening depend on the buffer size. 
To avoid that error when passing in a buffer go with a huge size like 6MB, 
which can hold at least 18,000 thread and process info structs and is more 
than adequate for most all systems, making that error highly unlikely.
An example of this is in main() in example4.c
-

-
TRAVERSE_FLAG_RECYCLE:

As documented in #flags, this flag should only be used if you are passing in 
as input an output buffer from a previous call. In this case none of the above 
documentation for buffer applies, and this function will not change the 
contents of buffer.
-

-
TRAVERSE_FLAG_EXTENDED:

As documented in #flags, this flag alters the request to 
NtQuerySystemInformation(). Although the buffer still receives an array of 
SYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION structs, the 'Threads' member is not an array of 
SYSTEM_THREAD_INFORMATION, but instead SYSTEM_EXTENDED_THREAD_INFORMATION.

In this case to access any process info's thread info array special care must 
be taken to increment using a SYSTEM_EXTENDED_THREAD_INFORMATION pointer.
An example of this is in your_processing() in example4.c
-


# [IN OPTIONAL]
# 
# size_t buffer_bcount
#
The size of the buffer, above, in bytes.

if( !buffer ) then buffer_bcount is ignored.
if( buffer ) then buffer_bcount is a required parameter.


# [IN OPTIONAL]
# 
# DWORD flags
#
Any or none of the following:

-
TRAVERSE_FLAG_IGNORE_CALCULATION_ERRORS:

Warning: Use of this flag can cause program instability.

Continue on error when parsing structures. Useful if debugging.
Some calculation errors are fatal regardless and will cause premature return.

By default on a calculation error TRAVERSE_ERROR_CALCULATION is returned.
If calculation errors are ignored this function can attempt to recover, but 
that usually means bad data will be passed to your callback (and it may crash).

The return value is not meaningful if this flag is specified.
-

-
TRAVERSE_FLAG_DEBUG:

Warning: Use of this flag can cause program instability.

Print debug info to stdout.

All numbers output are in decimal format unless 0x prefixed.
-

-
TRAVERSE_FLAG_EXTENDED:

'SystemExtendedProcessInformation' is requested from 
NtQuerySystemInformation(), instead of the default 'SystemProcessInformation'.

Only if this flag is specified will the extended thread info members be valid:
XP+: StackBase, StackLimit, Win32StartAddress
Vista+: TebAddress

If this flag is not specified do not read or write to the extended members.
-

-
TRAVERSE_FLAG_ZERO_THREADS_OK:

Also call the callback for any process info reporting zero threads.

A process with zero threads is technically not a process, and by default any 
process info (spi) reporting zero threads is not passed to the callback.
-

-
TRAVERSE_FLAG_RECYCLE:

Use as input an output buffer from a previous call, rather than calling 
NtQuerySystemInformation() again. The orignal call that output to buffer must 
have returned either TRAVERSE_SUCCESS or TRAVERSE_ERROR_CALLBACK.

If the flag TRAVERSE_FLAG_EXTENDED was passed in for the original call it 
must also be passed in on a recycle call. Also both buffer and buffer_bcount 
must be the same as passed in the original call.

This function does not modify the buffer on a recycle call.

If any of these required conditions are not met parameter validation fails.
-

-
TRAVERSE_FLAG_TEST_MEMORY:

Warning: Use of this flag can cause program instability.

If this flag was passed in and this library was compiled using Microsoft's 
compiler then pointers are checked for access violations. It could make the 
application less reliable to continue after testing invalid pointers.
Note the warning in test_memory()'s overview in traverse_threads__support.c.

If test_memory() fails then either TRAVERSE_ERROR_PARAMETER or 
TRAVERSE_ERROR_ACCESS_VIOLATION is returned, depending on the circumstances.
-


# [OUT OPTIONAL]
# 
# LONG *status
#
pointer to a variable to receive the NTSTATUS code returned by 
NtQuerySystemInformation(). The status code is only useful when the following 
error codes are returned, and may otherwise be invalid:
TRAVERSE_ERROR_ALIGNMENT
TRAVERSE_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL
TRAVERSE_ERROR_QUERY



======
REMARKS:
======

Pointer arithmetic in this function is done using size_t, not uintptr_t. 
Although the two are the same in Windows, uintptr_t isn't always defined.

-
Sanity checks:

A sanity check done by this function calculates the thread info array size for 
each process info and compares that to the number of threads it reported. 
If the comparison fails, TRAVERSE_ERROR_CALCULATION is returned.

Another sanity check is done to make sure memory isn't accessed out of bounds 
when processing the buffer returned by NtQuerySystemInformation(). That 
function is undocumented and there is no guarantee that the next entry offsets 
are correct. If the check fails, TRAVERSE_ERROR_CALCULATION is returned.

Another sanity check is done on parameters using structured exception handling 
(SEH) to check for access violations. This is an additional check that is only 
enabled if this library was compiled using Microsoft's compiler *and* 
TRAVERSE_FLAG_TEST_MEMORY is passed in. This function may or may not continue, 
depending on whether it can recover. See TEST_MEMORY in #flags for more info.
-

-
Advanced:

Once a callback has been called with a particular process info (spi) all 
sanity checks have been done for that process info, and only the callback's 
return can prevent the traversing of the remaining threads for that process. 
What this means is that certain assumptions can be made. For example 
'remaining' will always decrease sequentially to 0 unless the callback isn't  
continuing normally. This means your callback could, for example, 
open a handle to a process the first time the process is encountered{1}, 
store that handle in pre-allocated storage pointed to by 'cb_param', 
use it on any subsequent calls if there are other thread infos remaining, 
and then close it on the call when remaining is 0 or if the callback is not 
continuing normally (skipping to the next process or forcing an abort).

Footnotes
{1} Detecting the first time the process info is passed to the callback can be 
confirmed by checking to see if the callback was passed the first thread info 
for that process. if( !sti || ( sti == (void *)&spi->Threads ) ) // new spi

======
RETURN:
======

This function returns 0 (TRAVERSE_SUCCESS) on success, or a negative number on 
error. Any buffer output should be considered invalid on error except as noted.

A return code can be converted to a user-readable literal string by calling 
traverse_threads_retcode_to_cstr() in traverse_threads__support.c

TRAVERSE_ERROR_GENERAL:
some general error in traverse_threads() other than those defined below.

TRAVERSE_ERROR_MEMORY:
malloc() failed to allocate memory for a temporary buffer.

TRAVERSE_ERROR_ALIGNMENT:
NtQuerySystemInformation() misalignment error.
usually this means the passed in buffer is unaligned.

TRAVERSE_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL:
NtQuerySystemInformation() length mismatch.
usually this means the passed in buffer is too small.

TRAVERSE_ERROR_QUERY:
NtQuerySystemInformation() some other problem. 
I have not had this occur but it could. Check the status code for more info.

TRAVERSE_ERROR_CALLBACK:
callback function returned abort.
buffer output is valid (NtQuerySystemInformation() returned STATUS_SUCCESS), 
but has not been checked by traverse_threads() beyond the abort point.

TRAVERSE_ERROR_CALCULATION:
calculation error determining number of threads in a process, or memory out of 
bounds, etc. returning on a calculation error is a safeguard to prevent 
against parsing corruption.

TRAVERSE_ERROR_PARAMETER:
parameter check failed during initialization. invalid variable, pointer, etc.

TRAVERSE_ERROR_ACCESS_VIOLATION:
an access violation occurred while accessing pointed to memory. invalid pointer.
