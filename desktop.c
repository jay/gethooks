/** 
This file contains functions for a desktop store (linked list of desktops' heap and thread info).
Each function is documented in the comment block above its definition.

For now there is only one desktop store implemented and it's a global store (G->desktops).
'G->desktops' depends on the global program (G->prog) and configuration (G->config) stores.

-
create_desktop_store()

Create a desktop store and its descendants or die.
-

-
attach()

Attach the calling thread to a desktop and record its heap info in a desktop item.
Calls SetThreadDesktop().
-

-
thread()

This is the worker thread main function.
Calls attach() to attach to a desktop.
-

-
add_desktop_item()

Create a desktop item, attach to a desktop, and append the item to the desktop store's linked list.
Calls _beginthreadex() to call thread(), or calls attach() directly.
-

-
EnumDesktopProc()

Callback that EnumDesktopsW() passes desktop names.
Calls add_desktop_item().
-

-
add_all_desktops()

Add all desktops in the current window station.
Calls EnumDesktopsW() to call EnumDesktopProc().
-

-
init_global_desktop_store()

Initialize the global desktop store by attaching to the user-specified or default desktop(s).
Calls add_all_desktops(), or calls add_desktop_item() for each desktop if not adding all.
-

-
print_desktop_item()

Print an item from a desktop store's linked list.
-

-
print_desktop_store()

Print a desktop store and all its descendants.
-

-
print_global_desktop_store()

Print the global desktop store and all its descendants.
-

-
free_desktop_item()

Free a desktop item (dirty -- linked list isn't updated).
-

-
free_desktop_store()

Free a desktop store and all its descendants.
-
