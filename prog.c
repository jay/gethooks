/** 
This file contains functions for a program store (command line arguments, system info, etc).
Each function is documented in the comment block above its definition.

For now there is only one program store implemented and it's a global store (G->prog).

-
create_prog_store()

Create a program store and its descendants or die.
-

-
get_SharedInfo()

Return the address of Microsoft's SHAREDINFO structure (aka gSharedInfo) or die.
-

-
init_global_prog_store()

Initialize the global program store by storing command line arguments, OS version, etc.
-

-
print_SharedInfo()

Print some pointers from the SHAREDINFO struct.
-

-
print_prog_store()

Print a program store and all its descendants.
-

-
print_global_prog_store()

Print the global program store and all its descendants.
-

-
free_prog_store()

Free a program store and all its descendants.
